Gone Girl	TYC	Fantastic film. Can't speak any more highly about it. A must watch!!!! Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	some wrote fincher at his best. it is. the movie of the year hands down.its easily beat the interstellar and other shit came out this year.i saw a million movie in my fuckin entire life, but its in the top 10. All waveing emotions, its fantastic.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Can anyone tell me the name of the song used is this trailer? I've tried looking it up myself already but no luck..Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This Movie was pure suspense. You better get your snacks and restroom visits out of the way before it starts. Because you will not be able to take your eyes off of the screen for a moment once it gets going.  I also wonder if it was left open for a sequel. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Gillian Flynn took how we view the idea of Marriage and kicked us in the balls. This is a psycho drama and a half.And David Fincher brought it to stunning life. Affleck and Pike are excellent.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Dude this movie is amazing, it is a must watch.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This actually looks pretty damn good.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Is Darcy Donavan in this?  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1261965/?ref_=nv_sr_2Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Oh man, if you liked the trailer, wait till you scroll down and experience one person saying it was amazing and the next shitting on it...its amazing , it makes you wanna go see it even more..so you can comment too, and then start arguing with those who found it shit or good...I ma gonna watch it and come backÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Ben, would never kill his wife,a movie maybe, although after Argo we shouldnt say that no moreÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Incredible movie. Hitchcock-esque.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Great film.David Finched knows what he's doing.Thoroughly interesting, tense, and continues to build and build (you feel really smart walking away from the movie if you follow most of it).He'll even Tyler Perry was great.That one was taken too farüòÅüòÅ.If you've seen the flick, you know what I'm talking about, if you're going to, you will.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Just watched it, ULTRA SHIT.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Does anybody know the song for this trailer?Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Do not trust girls cause they can fart and poop.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	best movie I've ever seenÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	such a great movie with unexpected twists and turns i hear oscar bells ringing!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Typical 'suspense/mystery' trailer.  Make the audience 'THINK' one thing and then flip it on them in the ending.  Whatever this shows, Ben Affleck character as a possible killer, its probably total opposite. That way, everyone who sees the movie will be like 'OH!  I DIDN"T SEE THAT COMING!"Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie is fucking amazingÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Is this movie worth watching? Because I don't think so from the trailer.. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	can you recommend some good movies? (No mature content)i stopped watching movies 3 years ago because american movies contained lots of mature content, and stupid gay stuff !Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Movie was very amazing in my opinion, the plot twist was a shocker it wasn't like an any old crime scene movies, really was unexpected. Love it!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	aweeeesomeee moovieee ! must watch. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	So I'm currently reading the book and the film and book seem EXTREMELY similar. But everyone keeps telling me it's different. Without spoiling, can someone tell me why or how it's different? No spoilers plz Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	So what I gathered here is that Barney wanted to bang his wife and all the other female volunteers. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This film is silly and the lead female actor is terrible. I regret watching it in the cinema.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	One movie you can't miss. Totally loved it ! I actually thought it was a lame movie but its  pretty intense all the way. Ben Affleck absolutely delivered in this role. Rosamund Pike was "sweet", "innocent", stunning & vicious all the way. Definitely 7 / 10 in its categoryÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This plot sounds exactly like the Jeffrey MacDonald case from the 70'sÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	CANNOT wait to see gone girl I read the book, amazing, I was so scare after reading it was hard to sleep lol Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	One of the best movies of this year. Rosamund Pike deserves an Oscar for her performance. She stole the picture.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Ben AssfleckÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	DUMB movie!!!! Don't waste your money.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This trailer is such garbage, fortunately the movie was great.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie seems kinda boringÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Didn't like it at all...Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	movie was great. highly recommend. Ôªø

Gone Girl	TYC	Was Nick Dunne lying? Come out and find out how this thrilling story turns out!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie was amazing!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Great movie!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	If you like a movie that makes you think and feel every emotion possible then this is the movie for you. From the beginning you feel sympathy for Nick and Amy but as the movie goes on you begin to see how psychotic and twisted she and this whole movie are. It's a long movie but it's lots to take in. Hands down an amazing movie, would see it over and over againÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	She fakes everything, Still alive.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	It started out as a good mystery, but halfway through the plot, it took a turn in a twisted and psycho sort-of-way, that made it too unbelievable for me to take serious and genuinely enjoy.I understand that film-makers constantly try to think-up of new and differnt narratives to keep movie-goers returning to the movies, but when things get so unrealistically extreme, it loses it's potentiality and probability to even identify with the story or characters in a substantive way.  I found the evolution of a character (won't spoil who) into this monster, very thin, mostly lacking, and I was not persuaded.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	it was long time ago after i watched the trailer in the theater , my mind was kinda left hanging there. n i decided to read the book, i couldn't wait until the movie came out. however i only read 1/4 of the book cuz i decided to leave the rest thoughts of it at the movie. so emotional..so twisted.....so unbelievable .Yet i didn't finish the movie i left 20 min earlier cuz i wanted to finsih the boooook!!!!!!now i really go into watch the movie again!!!!  rating:++++++Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	It's very twisted psychopathic and gory. Be prepared.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Just saw this movie today with my boyfriend and it was the best movie I've seen in a minute. I give it 5 stars üòç like omg Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Just got done seeing it at the movies. Well done. That was one twisted movie. I love it:)Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	AMAZING film. Insanely twisted plot. Had me hooked until the end. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Great movie Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I loved it! :)Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Have you seen this? Can't wait to see it and Budhapest hotel. Meant to be amazing.üòäÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	this was a pretty good movie, and i haven't said that in a long time.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	FUCK YOU GUYS before saying a spoiler Atleast insert a caution thing or something !!!! Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Most amazing film I have ever seen, it has messed with my mind so much, 100% recommend it to everyone!!!!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	He doesn't kill his wife, she frames him though (but it doesn't work out how she wants it to). There I just saved you a trip to the movies Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	MGTOWÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Gone Girl is yet another masterpiece of Mr. FINCHER. It starts off a bit slow then jolts you though.a long tunnel of lies,sex,greed,murder and love. You never know where you are going or how you are going to.end up there. But the ride is a beautiful one. This is hands down the movie of the year for me. Thank You David FincherÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	i'm never gonna watch this, so just tell me did he kill her ar what?Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie seems fucked up, but steel want to see itÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Man this movie was so dope...Had so many twists you won't even guess the endingÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie is so  long and you will still be stuck to your seats to the last moment..this movie builds up even when it has such static screenplay..but i was hoping that please don't disappoint in the end please don't be a cliff hanger and guess what this has to be the biggest cliff-hangar...i don't know what you guys will feel but i was so disappointed in the very last moment i was hoping for something crazy to make this movie memorable for the entire build up that had made me sit in that theater for 2 hours but the ending made this movie forgettable and only credit it gets is this comment for the world to read at...strictly my own opinion but do watch this movie as you will not be bored till the very end but you will come out disappointed and forget about it easily but at least you time will not be a waste for the period sitting this movie...Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I never read the book but was there ever a sequel to the book? I really want to know if they would make a sequel to the movies...Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Great movieÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	damn this movie paints a terrible picture of women.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I smell an Oscar.......Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The only thing that should've been murdered in this movie was Ben Affleck's acting career.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Great movie, even better book tho :-)Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Gone girl and Interstellar are the best movies that've come out this year. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Read the book; hope the movie is just as good! ;)Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	in that first interview scene ben affleck looked like trent reznor a little.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	FILM IS FUCKING SHIT DONT WASTE YOUR TIME PLEASE Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I have to say after I saw this trailer, I was really excited about this movie knowing that it is a David Fincher movie but I have to say I was pretty disappointed. The plot had so much potential but in the end it was just filled with holes. The ending was not satisfying to me at all. I hope there is a sequel cause I left the theater with many unanswered questions.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The book is so much better.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Very good movie. I didn't think I would be impressed but it was actually a real good movie. I heard the book was good tooÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	damn this movie.. if i ever learned anything from the movie it will be like this : "Beware the levelheaded when she is angry..cause if she did then be careful from the war coming after you!"Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	went in to see that movie yesterday with my boyfriend and 2 of our friends.. after we left the cinema i could hear him say "i'm never getting married" i could totally get where he got it from, but yeah its a good movie that can mindfuck u so i recommend it :)Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	In many ways, this is very much similar to Basic Instinct. In both movies, the female sociopathic killer is a writer who uses her body to seduce men and play herself as the victim.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Watched this today and it sucked !! What a way to waste my weekend :/Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Awesome movie. .Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	My mom took me to see this and I gotta say... it was awkward because we didn't expect there to be 15+ sex scenes......Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Holy shit! This movie was fucking awesome! There was not one single boring scene in this movie! I was so engaged the whole time and the story is so fucked up! I love it!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Best movie I've seen in years! Had me on an emotional roller coaster. With a lot of dark funny humor! It has a lot of twist and turns! Easily get a 10/10 from me! And I had to be talked into watching it and didn't really want to. So glad I did!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	His wife staged her death ... js Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Such an amazing movie, disturbing as hell.Ôªø

Gone Girl	TYC	Holy hell this is one of the creepiest ones especially when I just came back from watching it.. Characters are so real and can happen so easily around us..Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	FEW SPOILERS: This movie was coked up on drama and because of its several plot twists kept you curiously intrigued. The story-line wasn't a masterpiece but was just enough to hail the movie as a strong attempt at pure sophistication. To be honest, I fell in love with Anne by the end of the movie. You'd have to be somewhat crazy yourself to do what Nick did at the end. But when you think about how much he's always wanted to please or impress her and how he was finally able to achieve that by his tv interview so much so that she came back to him, I think a part of him wanted to relish in that feat. Furthermore, the creative genius of Anne by itself is enough to make any man marvel. Personally, as fucked up as it sounds, I'd want to keep a woman as fricking brilliantly crazy as her, especially if I found out that she's pregnant with my baby. All in all, I say this was a good movie because it kept you interested literally after every other scene, and because it gives you the screwed up ending which is the best ending to a film coked up on drama. I recommend it.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I liked the movie a lot. The ending had me a little disappointed but it was an overall good movie. Excellent trailer also, it makes us think that the husband is the one that's crazy. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	She kidnapped herself, man.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	crazy Bitch Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie is just amazing!! Just watch it! It's not a CSI episode, it's soooo much more!!Ôªø

Gone Girl	TYC	Just saw this movie. definitely one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I loved how thought-provoking it was...I felt like I was always trying to think of something, like clues or certain things I've missed, but there was nothing there to grab. Amazing how a movie so plain and open can be so mind-bending.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	teleios xazomara,petamena lefta...Ôªø

Gone Girl	TYC	Just watched this movie @cinema todayI absolutely luved the movie üòÅüòÅÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	i enjoyed watching this movie very much.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	what this film does as far as its commentary/satire on modern media is tremendous. Honestly had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Saw #GoneGirl yesterday at #Palace #Barracks - it IS as good as everyone says!What‚Äôs the #book like?http://ow.ly/DIpKwÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Seems like a lot of talk! Blah blah, yadda yadda for 2 hours and 25 minutes?! I'll pass.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	ricky dillons snapchat brought me... lolÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Why are there always assholes who feel the need to give away the whole fucking story? You idiots should eat shit and die.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Good movie, bizarre and complex, and not for kids. Nothing formulaic about it 4/5.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I just saw the movie. FUCKING PSYCHO CRAZY BITCHÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I wana watch this movie...#gonegirlmovie  Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	just watched it. was just indescribably phenomenal. I was totally engrossed into the movie for the whole time and just because how stunned I was by the level of masterpiece this was, I stayed for the credits to give honor the people who worked on this project. Great movie, creepy at times but i definitely recommend everyone to watch it Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Quiero verlaÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Is this movie worth watching?Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The girl never dies she faked the murder to frame her husbandÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Yeah the story and plot line were pretty good but seriously what's with the annoying ending... And the trailer makes the movie seem so clean whereas when you watch it it's really disgusting and explicit so Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	just watched it..a truly outstanding movie with a killer plotÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	How is the movie?Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Spoiler alert She is a crazy bitchÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Some of you will be happy to know we get to see a lot of Rosamund's feet in this movie. Worth it. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Whats more terrifying than to watch a female psychopath on Halloween.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The movie was so good until the end. They completely ruined it with a horrible ending. I am so disappointed with how it ended I probably won't ever watch the movie again. Everyone in the theater said "Are you kidding me?" when the movie ended. Just a total disappointment.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Does anywhere know where I can watch this online????Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Just seen this movie today and just got home from seeing it lol.The plots was so twisted in this movie had me confused lol.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Very poor filmÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	david fincher: "hey, why dont I create a movie for all those hipster faggots"Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I know this film gets really but really fucked up!! It's still amazing though.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The moral is that women are wicked and you better be using a condom and not marrying just because she's pretty because women have a lot of power in society with the media.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I hate when people are just sooo close minded. This film in my opinion is about people and how they can never be perfect with their psychological problems and in the end nobody wants the supposedly peaceful life. Especially men. They are bored with their 'cool' girls in the end. People can not be satisfied. All people are masochists or sadists and egoistical narcissists. We deserve eachother. Nick deserved Amy and Amy deserved Nick. In the end, we want the same, more or less. I think the ending was about how Nick really wanted to stay with Amy. He just couldn't admit it. Amy was more clever, and she knew it. Nick had masochistic tendencies.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Haven't seen such s good movie in awhile! Gone girl has such an interesting storyline! Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Gone girl is indeed a masterpiece. No flaws. Good acting. Great story. After the movie it took me some time to move on. My mind was totally blown. It didn't even feel like the movie is over, im fact there is no ending. Very brilliant.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I like drama but this movie is laying it on too thick and too long as a substitute for a good story ....we are so addicted to drama that we fail to realize that drama *human conflict* is the result of unresolved human problems and that it THESE problems that need  to be addressed BEFORE it turns deadly. Oh, but then it would not be as dramatic. But imagine if this drama was instead focused on  their conscious and unconscious conflicts? It would show a solution, it would show what is needed, and what was unknown to both of them, respectively, and it would show us, the audience, the complexity of human conflicts and how it was resolved. In other words, the story would have social redeeming value. Unfortunately, no one wants that. The masses want violence, sex, and all manner of killing. It's what Eckart tolle refers to as painbodiesÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	For those of you saying the film sucks for some reason, I strongly suggest that you watch the movie again. The first hour or so is certainly a drag because of how disjointed everything feels. However, the director does an excellent job of tying things together and revealing to the audience at JUST THE RIGHT MOMENT what it is that is going on, and I was hooked for the rest of the movie. Sure there was a lot of sex, but I guess I can't really complain. It wasn't exactly gratuitous as such, and was there at the right moment and all. Over all, 9.5/10. Good job team!!!Ôªø

Gone Girl	TYC	Hmmmm. I  might wait for the DVD!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	very stupid storyline......lady...you are frightened of your own husband....why did u marry him in the first place. idiot. you didnt notice anything all those times of dating? bitchÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	BarneY Is there...Its  obvious what happen there :)Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	My God there's like a constant flow of important dialogue in this trailer. Why not just show the whole fucking movie? A smart person could predict the twist of this film watching this trailer only.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	You have watched the trailer, you will get boring pretty fast in the first 15 minutes, but you won't be disappointed when you watch all of this movie.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Just give her the Oscar already. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I'm 15 and I'm reading the book. Yes, lots of colourful language like f**ks, c***s etc. But truly, the writing's got me hooked. AND GUESS WHAT ITS R21 *proceeds to pull hair out* I kinda hated Amy from the start anyway... Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Gone GirlÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I watched this yesterday and it was filled with suspense and action and I just loved that it's soo soo twisted and devious Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Dark movieÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Went into this movie having not read the book so no expectations.... Wow, was it twisted! All the actors where amazing and believable and likable. So much going on I think I need to see it again... As for the ending... You'll be thinking & talking about it forever!!   BEST ACTRESS  for me this year  Rosamund Pike!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This just shows what lerks beneath all women. ..Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	If your thinking about watching it, seriously just go, it's so well done. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Ok so I watched it cause people told me it's really good and all.I really don't know what to think.. I mean, I liked this movie, but in the other side I'm like wtf is going on at the end. Really confused..Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I dont even know where to place this movie. I cant lie because i was excited while watching it, cause it was very puzzling and unpredictable in many ways...i left the cinema with mixed emotions - excitment, confusion, uncertainty...but very impressed with Rosamund Pike's acting skills...However, it was not until a few days later that i realized just how pointless the whole plot was. No firm ground, no beginning, no real buildup, no ending, just a senseless movie. It is still worth watching i guess, cause it is entertaining, but i dont think it will age very well. It will be forgotten very soon.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	My wife creeps me out now Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Best movie EVER!!!!! Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Just got back from this movie, it is amazingly good (though a liitle bit too long and therefore drawn out in the first half with parts where not much happened), with astounding acting from the leads and great atmosphere and plot! Loved, LOVEDD it :D Ôªø

Gone Girl	TYC	Ben AssfleckÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Wow, this trailer really played me, because this movie is so unpredictable #mindblown  Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Good movie 8/10 . All i hear is "the ending was shit " , "awful ending " blah blah blah . The ending was a switch from normal which makes sense and is a good eye opener for the fact that *Spoiler*She got away with it and she succeeded in her goals which the audience clearly just dismisses because she was guilty and they felt that she needed to be caught .It left nick trapped and become a pretty sinister cliff hanger , i dont think its a movie that will wow all viewers at all but watch it . End Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	A lot of people are complaining that this movie didn't make sense, that it was rather absurd. They are correct. The genius of the movie is that it applies the current filter of our culture every step of the way. Selfies with the husband, ceaseless media coverage, anchors making judgments and narratives based on no actual evidence, and an inability to understand how people are actually living their lives. Its a lurid, bizarre tale, but in context of our society, it makes perverse sense.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie had so much turns. I didnt know who to be mad at thats for sure. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Just another reason not to get married...Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This is how David Fincher's "storytelling skills" matters!!! Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Am I the only girl who thinks Ben Affleck is so hot?:/Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	what A movie !!! Love it Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	this film took me on an emotional roller coaster. Everything you think you know keeps changing but reaffirming itself. Just watch it. Like now. Do it. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Bridgette - why the fuck even write that you fucking dumb bitch!!? I dont care that you wrote spoiler alert, i was scrolling down, went past that and read to much already!! Now delete your comment before you ruin this movie for anyone else you ignorant fuck!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	love this movie, best movie i've ever seen, Gone Girl is a must-watch movie that you never want to miss !!!!!!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This is the best movie ive seen in a ong time :O Hope this wins best picture oscar Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The best thriller movie I've ever seen.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	this movie gonna be legend..... dary!!!!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	***SPOILER ALERT***PLEASE don't call this movie a"feminist movie" . When Amy revealed that she faked her disappearanceand death, planning a day to escape for 365 days, writing a diary,going through all that trouble just for a man who cheated on her Ithought to myself 'She's desperate!" As far as I'm concerned 'AmazingAmy' was independent, smart, and could lure any man into her life. Whywould such a brilliant woman go through all that trouble for a man whojust cheated on her? And even consider suicide? LOL I'm notdown-playing infidelity but it could've been a lot worse. He could'veraped/physically abused her or even more. (Pushing her once in a momentof rage was excusable) but then again, she was psychotic, so youquestion what really did happen??Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Too many unresolved issues that were just glossed over or not thought through. I hope the book was better.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	When I saw the title I thought, white girl wasted! Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	just saw the movie...The movie is not bad but it's not a movie 8/10 I would give a 7/10... I believe the main reason is Ben Afflect his performance is very average... Rosamund Pike was perfect ... Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	main thing i learned: bitches be crazy!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Check out this video on YouTube:Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	alguien me puede explicar porque al final el acepta quedarse con ella?? acaso el tambien esta mal de la cabeza? Honestamente me encanto la pel√≠cula pero no se el final no me convenci√≥ Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie is really good, the actors are great, the soundtrack is awesome, the story is interesting and clever. But at the end I just felt like something was missing... Though it definitely leaves you with something to think about.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Sux to be her husband LolÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	1:30 Ben Affleck was cast because that "so convicing" smile... :vÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Just got back from this movie and what can I say...The twists were so stupid that it made the movie harder to follow and the ending was complete trash. Affleck was great in his role and the wife was great to. The outcome;however, was rubbish. 3/10Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I must admit, the movie was good. I think I would have enjoyed reading the book before hand - I think I would have had a better vibe - thrilling, psychological - yes, and I would recommend.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	EPIC movie. Must see this one.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The story could be "built" in more of  a hint, which corresponds to the music. I really don't like the aditing. It is not well-synchronized with the text at all.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	what's the name of the song used in this trailer?Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I love ben affleck dick üòçÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	From the Director of Se7en and Zodiac...Gone Girl (18):- 8:50pm = Every evening up to ThursdayPlot: 'With his wife's disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man sees the spotlight turned on him when it's suspected that he may not be innocent.' (IMDb)Starring: Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike#DoverCinema #UKÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	superb, twisted, the power of VAG! i fckin love this movie,..Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I can't take Neil serious in a thriller film. LolÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I loooved this movie I don't wanna spoil but I almost wanted Amy to get arrested and sentenced to death!! I didn't really like Rosamund Pike somehow but now I love her her acting was perfect so was Ben Affleck'sÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	this movie was really good. lots of kids dislike it cuz there is no constant action and you have to think a little during this twisted story. One of the best I've seen in a while.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Trent Reznor & David Fincher Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I really enjoyed this film.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Another cliffhanger? Since people like suspence than the payoff irk if that can happenÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	it was a good movie, trust me u assume it is something, like a CSI girl gone missing, serious mastermind planned the whole thing from top to bottom it not. But still good movieÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	AmazingÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	i just watched this movie tonight.... Absolutely AMAZING!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The movie is good. Not as good as Saving Private Ryan as it doesn't drag you into the story as much, but if you like WW2 stuff, definately worth seeing. Especially liked when at the end the german solder didn't turn him in when he saw him under the tank!!! Also, wasn't too excited about Brad Pitt's play . ..  not saying he's not a grat actor, but not sure if he was best for this roleÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This is perhaps the best movie trailer I've ever seen. I was more engaged here than in some full movies. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I wish I had not wasted my time and money reading the book!  Stupid plot and ending!Ôªø

Gone Girl	TYC	i loved this filmÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Watched the movie! OMG, its awesome!!! Enjoyed it, a lot!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I love Ben Affleck for being so bold and open minded about his opinions on Muslims. I know most people won't agree but I really respect him for being so non-judgemental.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I watched this movie today. It was pretty disturbing but so impactful. The female lead Rosamund was fantastic. Effectively creepy. Great acting.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	"Ohhhh...so you don't think I can play the role of Batman eh?..."Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	PIT STAIN AT 0:51Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie was SO good. You need to see it yourselfÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	"Ever hear the expression - the simplest answer is usually the correct one?""Actually, I've never found that to be true."Way to make a puzzle more puzzling.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Such a great film!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Wtf!!! This is some crazy shit. How can the movie just end like that??!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	An absolutely brilliant movie!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Blonde bitches must deserve to die.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie is based on a book, so don't pull all of the weight on the writers of this film. And this movie was actually EXTREMELY well made and I hate that so many people judge it based on the trailer because it is nothing like the trailer at all. There are so many twists and turns. I suggest reading the book afterwards because there are some difference between the book and the film, but they're both great.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	After the movie ended, talking to my wife was like talking to an alligator. This is a woman who listened to the entire book on audio, knowing every twist and turn the film was going to make, and was hard to be surprised in a theatre because of. Then i am remembered of your existence. While sitting in the opening credits, i'm enthralled of the film's score from the start. The creepiness of it, etc. Then i start reading, and say "Oh wow!!! David Fincher directed this? really???????". Wife didn't respond, as this meant nothing to her. So then i explained...."David Fincher....directed Zodiac. NUFF SAID" Then i said " David Fincher, he directed Benjamin Button...NUFF SAID". She gave me a look and i could tell SHE wanted to tell me "nuff said". So we just watched the movie. Before the beginning credits ended, i was already in love with this movie. I knew Fincher wouldn't let me down. To start, i haven't been this nervous in a movie since The Call. I loved everything about it. They couldn't get better actors or actresses for these parts (wife will disagree since she hates Ben) however i thought he played it out nicely. Halfway in the movie, i thought "WOW..........FATAL ATTRACTION". (if you haven't seen this movie you are encouraged too). Then i thought, "no. this is 2014's Fatal Attraction" and i was in a for a ride for my life. But we all know the biggest subject to date now is "the ending of this movie.....what....". However i believe Zach and I are the only people that share the appreciation of such ending. Ask yourself, do we really want an ending that pulls every piece together perfectly? Do we really want or NEED all ties untangled and wires straightened out? What did you want to see happen? It end in divorce court, a regular Judge Judy session? Sounds boring to me. Let me know your thoughts. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I did not like this movie tbhÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This is one hundred percent my ex wife in this movie!!!!!It gave me the shivers watching this! Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Alright so I do not see the hate for this movie. In case you think it is like Criminal Minds or CSI or any of the shows that repeat the same cases and ideas with no further character development, you're wrong. The movie brings the subject of marriage, media, and the simple showing of how we get from one point to another, the line being what have we done to each other. Now the score is easily the best of the year, if not top 10 or 20 of all time. Performances are top notch, directing is amazing, it screams all the elements an amazing movie has. But unlike most films, it has a sense of mysteriousness throughout. Maybe it's the soundtrack, performances, or directing style, but the movie always keeps you guessing, and when climaxes or intense scenes come the movie knocks you out. The movie is incredible with the deep psychology of American Psycho. Don't hate on the movie when you already payed $12 to see the new Transformers and you came out saying meh. This compared to that is not meh, it's a phenomenon in fact. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	OF all people why would you put Tyler Perry in a movie like this.How im i suppose to take him seriousÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	 Ben Affleck is a great actor, just give him a good script and a world class director like David Finche and he will deliver just like he did in "Argo" "The Town"Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	How the hell is this is a good movie? It's fucking trash. I love smart movies, love huge plot twists, and thought out stories. And then you get this piece of shit. I wish I could demand money back after watching a horrible movie at the cinema. The fact it even scored this high makes it even more laughable. The crowd nowadays doesn't know what a good movie is. Metacritics and other 'reviewers/experts' can f the hell off.If you plan on seeing this movie and you like REALLY good movies, for the love of god, avoid this one. You'll be beyond pissed at the ending.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I thought the movie was decent but the ending was just retarded. The way the cops just believed that she was raped was weak they should have at least investigated it because the husband did say all along that she was a PSYCHOPATH lolÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Rosamund Pike was amazing in this movie. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	ŸÇÿµŸá ŸÖÿ¨ŸÜŸàŸÜŸá Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	the best movie in 2014. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	i was straight, then i watched this movie and now im gay.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	possible spoilers!!!!!I googled a sentence "she faked her own death" and I didn't see what was written in articles on websites but on every page of results that has been written recently was an article about Gone Girl.Let me guess how it's ending ???? :)))) Sorry but that's not original.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	best movie I've seen this year!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	the trailer really doesn't give anything away, and i love that.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The whole movie Rosamund Pike set Ben Affleck up. Shes not dead. She later kills Neal Patrick Harris and use both the media and pregnancy to blackmail Ben Affleck. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Just another example of why you don't get marriedÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	i still do not understand why calum hood is scared of woman because of this movieÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I've got the book but it's just been sitting on my shelf unread due to the fact that I'm scared that all this hype will disappoint me.Is it worth a read or just stand clear from both book and movie?Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The entire movie was very good- never boring and are always intrigued. I really liked it.And then it ended- the ending ruined it.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	i just saw the movie, ben affleck is the only actor on earth who can blow the chance of being in a movie like this by giving a poor acting performance, this could have been the oportunity for him to win an oscar as an actor, any actor in the industry would have killed to be in this movie, and he acts like he is in gigli again, sad, it is going to be ages for him to appear in a movie like this again.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	OMG I NEED TO SEE THIS FILM NOWÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	je l'ai vu hier soir ... c'est long, ennuyeux, sans int√©r√™t !!s√ªrement le plus mauvais film  de david FINCHERÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Hardwell ? Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Isn't this a book because I think I've seen it?Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	
Gone Girl	TYC	Can't wait to see it....ooouw...how wonderful....OMG....Tyler perry..Affleck...n Rosa.....Buen.....Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Interesting movie, though with a strange end...Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	SPOILER. If I would b Nick, I would cut her throat and dumped body, as after she returns, no one would suspect Nick and hes wife would deserve it all. And pregnancy is not the case, as Nick would safe the kid from mother like that.I any case, movie was awesome.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Great Movie!!! and Trent Reznor adds a great level of depth with an AMAZING job with the score!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	 This movie is freaking Awesome....affleck rokx.....Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	What a cop out! Im sorry but that ending was very bad I hate movies and stories that don't know how to end so they don't. Yes that's it it didn't have an ending. BAH!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	fagÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	this movie was so stupideven tho it tried to be realistic it was so unreal and cops would have find all up :DÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	this was a good movie...lots of suspense.but saying its incredible, amazing, spectacular. that's a bit much.its a good..solid, 8/10. oscar worthy...not a chance.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	true detective was 10 times better than this...and won no awards.would be ironic if gone girl does win awards.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Really liked it...but a little too long! By the way - I love Rosamund Pike!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This is by far the best movie of 2014.....I have yet to see Interstellar though.Your move...creep.-RobocopÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I thought this movie was disgustingly negative and way too far fetched. Horrible ending and I didn't feel good watching this movie. Maybe these kinds of movies are just not for me.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen!!!! AMAZING!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was amazing!! Though I did see a pretty big flaw in the story. **********SPOILER ALERT************** (stop reading if you haven't seen the film)If she had been clubbed over the head with a blunt object and had left a massive pool of blood on the floor like the one she had created herself, she would've had to have a serious head injury. Infact, to make a pool of blood that big you would pretty much have to have your head caved in. So my question is, when she turned up and they took her to hospital, everyone would notice that she had no major head injuries and a completely intact skull - someone is bound to ask the question "Where did all this blood come from??" Her lies would then unravel. Sorry for dissecting an otherwise amazing movie lol =PÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie was fucking crazyÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Good movie but disappointing end. It was inappropriate for a thriller to end this way. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	For the one who didnt see the movie the wife is the killer! Fck holyyod bulsheet money eaters!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Warning! This movie will make you think twice about ever wanting to be in a relationship.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Frankie dies.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Doesn't the trailer show you everything? Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Another excellent work from Fincher, i wish the ending could be a bit more better than aside from that, it's a great movie. but i still hold Zodiac as his best workÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	AMAZING FILM, if you are saying the film doesn't make sense then you clearly didn't pay attention worth watching so if you WANNA WATCH THE FILM DON'T READ THE REST PLEASE COS WHEN YOU WATCH THE FILM YOU WONT HAVE THE WOW MOMENT, how do you think she got away with murdering her ex bf or flaming her husband? she made up a history that her ex boyfriend kidnapped her and kept her prisoner, so then that's why she calls him and puts red stuff on her clothes and looks for camera and put red stuff on her pants so then she can say he rapped her,when he comes back she kills him because her husband was on TV but SHE did this whole thing because she wanted her husbands attention and he wasn't giving her any and she saw he cheated on her, so then she planned all this so he could pay for what he did, she did this but she changed her mind when she saw her husband on TV saying it was a mistake and he apologizes for cheating on her, that he was a bad husband that he would be the same old guy that she met, so then it changed her mind and that's why she killed the ex boyfriend, once she comes back people don't understand why shes pregnant GUYS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM pay attention, in the beginning of the film he gives his sister a paper saying that says his sperm were frozen so she could have access to his sperm any time and get pregnant wherever she wanted to, so she was already pregnant before disappearing when she came back as well if you try to remember they had sex and it was only few days before she staged everything. and he is forced to stay with her cos it would look suspicious that after HIS PREGNANT WIFE, HAD BEEN RAPPED, SUFFERED AND CAME BACK NEARLY DEAD TO HER HUSBAND it would fucking hate him, and if she had the baby when he wasn't there she would prob just kill the baby and he couldn't get the full custody so that's why he decides to stay with her, cos he wouldn't see his kid, and she loves him deeply inside so that's why if you pay attention the film is intriguing and complicated, i have studied film studies it doesn't mean I'm specialist but i pay attention to details and here in america we are good at doing this. BTW I'm from china so my English is not very good. thank you if now you understand the film.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	can't waiiiit!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The trailer is amazingly misleading. Good movie! Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Saw this last night and was totally disappointed!  Walking out of the theatre so many were saying the same thing and the ending was so unfair to the viewers!!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie is legen... Wait for it...(He couldn't finish the sentence, he had, um, something stuck in his throat.)Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	A must-watch Fall film. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	David Fincher's best work since Fight ClubÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	WOW.. Just got back from seeing this movie! A must see, I am proud to say. The trailer doesn't give anything away. Definitely TOO many sex scenes with no real purpose, but the plot and twists and entertainment value are great.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Best thriller I've seen in years.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	If the first 1/3 of the film is typical crap, why is it in the film??!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	havent seen ben affleck in a while.. seems like an interesting movie.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	This movie is incredible! I think I may have liked it even more than the book, which is exceptionally rare. Go see it, everyone. It's seriously amazing.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	
Gone Girl	TYC	I don't know but, am I the only one who recently sees that the movies I've liked the most are kinda controversial among the internet people? they're either overrated or overhyped or any other idiotic term, not that I care but it seems weird, maybe I'm just reading more comments lately.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Spoiler alert: Bruce is batman!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I want to watch this movie but i hate tyler perry. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	the movie had a huge twist but it was still goodÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Mini film review: *Gone Girl.*We were very positively surprised. It's a *very different* film from what you would imagine from the trailer.It's a deep, smart and disturbing exploration of gender roles, marriage and modern media. But not in a boring way at all. üòúGreat acting and directing. There isn't a second wasted in the entire film: everything fits together to form the big picture (and puzzle).Definitely worth watching. I predict it will become a classic.My only complaint is the heavy and obnoxious product placement all over the place. This is the same director from *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* and he does here the same sad thing that he did to that film. Really stupid. I think he realises it because in the second half of the film, when we get deeper into the emotional mud, the product placements almost disappear, thankfully.Warning: not for kids! There's graphics violence, although it's not the centre of the story.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Saw Gone Girl yesterday. Highly recommended, excellent movie. Time to add David Fincher to my list of favourite directors, as he now has four movies on my all time top 50 (the others being se7en, Fight Club and the Game)Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Moral of the story:Don't get marriedÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	The book was amazing and i bet the movie is going to be greatÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Someone will hate the ending. The wife had not been arrested for framing her husband and murdering Neil Patrick Harris. Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	Wtf theres no batman? :DÔªø
Gone Girl	TYC	
Gone Girl	TYC	No one ever suspects the cat.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	It seemed like the movie was glossing over the pages of a great story. I haven't read the book but something feels like it's MISSING from the film...anyone else feel like that too?Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I'm so going niggaaaaa!!!Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	I'm Batman.Ôªø
Gone Girl	TYC	WHAT AN AMAZING MOVIE!!! A+ MUST SEE! For the first time the trailer does NOT give away the movie! You will be intrigued the whole way! VERY nicely done! Totally entertaining! Just what I needed tonight! If you haven't seen it yet GO! Not suitable for kids. Ôªø
